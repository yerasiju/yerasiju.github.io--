	<p>An ecosystem (or ecological system) consists of all the organisms and the physical environment with which they
		interact.These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy
		flows. Energy enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue. By feeding on plants
		and on one another, animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system. They
		also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead organic matter,
		decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored
		in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and microbes.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Ecosystems are controlled by external and internal factors. External factors such as climate, parent material
		which forms the soil and topography, control the overall structure of an ecosystem but are not themselves
		influenced by the Internal factors are controlled, for example, by decomposition, root competition,
		shading, disturbance, succession, and the types of species present. While the resource inputs are generally
		controlled by external processes, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by
		internal factors. Therefore, internal factors not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by
		them.</p>
