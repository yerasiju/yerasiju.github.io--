	<main>
		<p>An ecosystem (or ecological system) consists of all the organisms and the physical environment with which they
			interact. These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.
			Energy enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue. By feeding on plants and
			on one another, animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system. They
			also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead organic matter,
			decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients
			stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and microbes.</p>

		<p>Ecosystems are controlled by external and internal factors. External factors such as climate, parent material
			which forms the soil and topography, control the overall structure of an ecosystem but are not themselves
			influenced by the Internal factors are controlled, for example, by decomposition, root competition, shading,
			disturbance, succession, and the types of species present. While the resource inputs are generally controlled
			by external processes, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal
			factors. Therefore, internal factors not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them.</p>

	<h3 .test id="comon comon">Parent material determines the nature of the soil in an ecosystem, and influences the
		supply of
		mineral nutrients. Topography also controls ecosystem processes by affecting things like microclimate, soil
		development and the movement of water through a system. For example, ecosystems can be quite different if situated
		in a small depression on the landscape, versus one present on an adjacent steep hillside</h3>
